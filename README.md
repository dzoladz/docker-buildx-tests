Docker Buildx - Tests
=====================

[![Github Action](https://github.com/jdrouet/docker-on-ci/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dzoladz/docker-buildx-tests/actions)

This repository uses [Docker Buildx](https://github.com/docker/buildx) and applies Continuous Integration (CI) - via GitHub Actions and Secrets - to build a multi-architecture Docker image; then, publish it to Docker Hub.

## Docker Hub Token and Github Secrets

Obtain an access token on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/settings/security) in the security settings. If you rely on the free-tier of Docker Hub, your only option will be to create a token with Read, Write, Delete access permissions.

Once you have copied the Docker Hub token, youâ€™ll need to create two secrets in your repository in the Secrets section of Settings. Create a `DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_HUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` secret to store the values for login to your Docker Hub account.
